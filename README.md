# üßë‚Äçüíª Dart Basics Learning Project

This project is designed to help you learn the fundamental concepts of Dart programming. It covers essential features such as asynchronous programming, collections (list, map, set), error handling, and working with streams. Each file demonstrates a specific concept or Dart feature with examples.

## üìÇ Files

1. **async-await.dart**
   - Demonstrates how to use **`async`** and **`await`** to handle asynchronous code.
   - Learn how to handle operations that take time (such as network requests, file reading, etc.) without blocking the main thread.

2. **futures.dart**
   - Shows how to work with **`Future`** objects, which represent values that are available at some point in the future.
   - Learn how to handle one-time asynchronous results and chain operations.

3. **list.dart**
   - Introduces Dart's **List** collection.
   - Learn how to create, access, and modify lists, as well as how to use common list methods.

4. **map.dart**
   - Introduces Dart's **Map** collection (key-value pairs).
   - Learn how to create, access, and modify maps, and iterate over key-value pairs.

5. **set.dart**
   - Demonstrates how to use Dart's **Set** collection (unique, unordered elements).
   - Learn how to add, remove, and check for elements in a set.

6. **streams.dart**
   - Explains how to use **Streams** in Dart for handling a sequence of asynchronous events or values.
   - Learn how to listen to events, pause, and resume the stream.

7. **try-catch.dart**
   - Demonstrates error handling in Dart using **`try`** and **`catch`** blocks.
   - Learn how to catch exceptions and handle them properly.
